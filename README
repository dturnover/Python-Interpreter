Python interpreter that uses a recursive descent parser to tokenize and process a corpus containing python code.

The resulting executable from the makefile is statement.x
An input file should be a .txt containing python code (I uploaded a sample input file)
To run the interpreter: ./statement.x an_input_file.txt

Variables for ints, doubles, strings and booleans are supported
For loops, if/else statements, print statemtents, and arithmetic expressions are supported
Functions are not supported
print statements are of the form: print [testlist]
